Creating documents with R Markdown starts with an .Rmd file that contains a combination of markdown (content with simple text formatting) and R code chunks. The .Rmd file is fed to knitr ⧉, which executes all of the R code chunks and creates a new markdown (.md) document which includes the R code and it’s output.
